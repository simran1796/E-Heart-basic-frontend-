		<p>Among various life-threatening diseases, heart disease has garnered a great deal of attention in medical research. 
The diagnosis of heart disease is a challenging task, which can offer automated prediction about the heart condition of patient so that further treatment can be made effective. 
The diagnosis of heart disease is usually based on signs, symptoms and physical examination of the patient.
There are several factors that increase the risk of heart disease, such as smoking habit, body cholesterol level, family history of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of physical exercise.
The health care industries collect huge amounts of data that contain some hidden information, which is useful for making effective decisions. 
For providing appropriate results and making effective decisions on data, some advanced techniques are used. In this study, an effective heart disease prediction system (EHDPS) is developed using web technology for predicting the risk level of heart disease. 
The system uses 15 medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity for prediction.  
It enables significant knowledge, eg, relationships between medical factors related to heart disease and patterns, to be established. 
The obtained results have illustrated that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of heart diseases.
A major challenge faced by health care organizations, such as hospitals and medical centers, is the provision of quality services at affordable costs.
The proposed system can determine an exact hidden knowledge, ie, patterns and relationships associated with heart disease from a historical heart disease information. 
It can also answer the complex queries for diagnosing heart disease; therefore, it can be helpful to health care practitioners to make intelligent clinical decisions. 
Results showed that the proposed system has its unique potency in realizing the objectives of the defined goals.
